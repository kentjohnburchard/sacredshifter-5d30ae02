# Root Chakra Awakening

This journey focuses on awakening and balancing the root chakra (Muladhara), the foundation of your energetic system. The 396Hz frequency helps release fear and guilt while establishing a sense of security and grounding.

## Intention

Set an intention to connect deeply with the earth, to feel secure in your physical existence, and to release fears that block your sense of safety and belonging.

## Practice

1. Sit comfortably with your sit bones firmly on the ground or floor
2. Feel the base of your spine connecting to the earth
3. Breathe deeply into the base of your spine
4. Visualize a strong red light glowing at the base of your spine, expanding with each breath
5. As you listen to the 396Hz tones, imagine roots growing from your base down into the earth
6. Feel yourself becoming more stable, secure, and grounded with each breath

The root chakra is your foundation. By strengthening it, you create stability for your entire energetic system to flourish.
