    description: "The All is Mind; The Universe is Mental.",
    explanation: "This principle explains that everything in the material universe is mental, a projection of the mind of the All. Consciousness is primary, matter secondary.",
    frequency: "963Hz",
    chakra: "Crown",
    scienceConnection: "Quantum physics shows that consciousness affects quantum systems through observation. The consciousness collapses quantum probability waves into particle reality.",
    frequencyEffect: "963Hz corresponds to pineal gland activation, higher consciousness, and unity awareness. This frequency enhances meditation, spiritual connection, and transcendent states.",
  },
  "Correspondence": {
    title: "Principle of Correspondence",
    description: "As Above, So Below; As Within, So Without.",
    explanation: "This principle demonstrates the harmony and connection between different planes of existence. Patterns repeat themselves across scale and dimension.",
    frequency: "852Hz",
    chakra: "Third Eye",
    scienceConnection: "Fractal mathematics and holographic theory show how patterns replicate at different scales. The structure of the atom resembles the structure of a solar system.",
    frequencyEffect: "852Hz aligns with intuition, insight, and clarity of perception. This frequency helps clear mental blocks, enhance visualization, and strengthen intuitive abilities.",
  },
  "Vibration": {
    title: "Principle of Vibration",
    description: "Nothing Rests; Everything Moves; Everything Vibrates.",
    explanation: "This principle reveals that everything is in constant motion at varying frequencies. Differences in vibration create different manifestations of matter, energy, and consciousness.",
    frequency: "528Hz",
    chakra: "Solar Plexus",
    scienceConnection: "String theory proposes that all particles are actually tiny vibrating strings, with different vibration patterns producing different particles.",
    frequencyEffect: "528Hz is known as the 'Miracle Tone' or 'DNA repair frequency'. It promotes transformation, increased energy, and manifestation of intentions.",
  },
  "Polarity": {
    title: "Principle of Polarity",
    description: "Everything is Dual; Everything has Poles; Everything has its Opposite.",
    explanation: "This principle shows that opposites are identical in nature but different in degree. All paradoxes can be reconciled through understanding this principle.",
    frequency: "639Hz",
    chakra: "Heart",
    scienceConnection: "Electromagnetism demonstrates polarity with positive and negative charges. The balance of opposing forces creates stability in physical systems.",
    frequencyEffect: "639Hz harmonizes relationships, promotes compassion, and helps resolve conflicts. This frequency balances emotional extremes and encourages understanding.",
  },
  "Rhythm": {
    title: "Principle of Rhythm",
    description: "Everything Flows; Out and In; All Things Rise and Fall.",
    explanation: "This principle describes the cyclic nature of all things. Pendulum swings manifest in everything from tides to economies, emotions to civilizations.",
    frequency: "417Hz",
    chakra: "Sacral",
    scienceConnection: "Circadian rhythms, economic cycles, and planetary movements all demonstrate the principle of rhythm in different domains.",
    frequencyEffect: "417Hz facilitates change, releases trauma, and enables creative flow. This frequency helps us break out of stagnant patterns and embody flow consciousness.",
  },
  "Cause & Effect": {
    title: "Principle of Cause and Effect",
    description: "Every Cause has its Effect; Every Effect has its Cause.",
    explanation: "This principle states that nothing happens by chance; there are causal connections among all events, though they may operate across planes and dimensions.",
    frequency: "741Hz",
    chakra: "Throat",
    scienceConnection: "Chaos theory shows how small causes can create large, unpredictable effects through sensitivity to initial conditions.",
    frequencyEffect: "741Hz empowers self-expression, creative manifestation, and living with integrity. This frequency helps clear toxicity and promotes speaking your truth.",
  },
  "Gender": {
    title: "Principle of Gender",
    description: "Gender is in Everything; Everything has Masculine and Feminine Principles.",
    explanation: "This principle reveals the creative interplay between receptive and projective energies in all things, from human relationships to atomic structure.",
    frequency: "396Hz",
    chakra: "Root",
    scienceConnection: "Particle-wave duality in quantum physics demonstrates complementary properties similar to the masculine (particle) and feminine (wave) aspects.",
    frequencyEffect: "396Hz grounds spiritual energy, provides stability, and releases fear. This frequency helps establish foundation and security while clearing blockages.",
