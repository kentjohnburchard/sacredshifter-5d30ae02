# Sound Files

This directory contains frequency audio files for the Focus page.

The app will look for the following files:
- `frequency-396hz.mp3` - For the 396Hz Liberation frequency
- `frequency-432hz.mp3` - For the 432Hz Miracle Tone frequency
- `frequency-528hz.mp3` - For the 528Hz Love frequency
- `schumann-resonance.mp3` - For the 7.83Hz Earth's frequency (Schumann resonance)
- `focus-ambient.mp3` - General ambient sound for focus sessions

If these files are not present, the app will fall back to the focus-ambient.mp3 file.
