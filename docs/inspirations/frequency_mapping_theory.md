# ðŸ“œ Frequency Mapping Theory

## Overview:
Mapping specific frequencies to emotional and energetic healing responses creates repeatable, scalable vibrational blueprints for transformation.

## Key Points:
- Frequencies correspond to physical body systems, emotional states, and energetic fields.
- Coherent frequency combinations amplify healing (e.g., Theta brainwaves + 432Hz + 528Hz).
- Field entrainment occurs faster with layered frequency exposure.

## Sacred Shifter Implementation:
- Create playlists or single-session tracks mapped to healing intent.
- Allow participants to intuitively self-select based on current energetic needs.
